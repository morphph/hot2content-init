  "markdown": "# 🌅 AI Daily Digest — 2026-02-10\n\n## 🧠 MODEL\n\n• **Holo2-235B** — H Company 发布新模型，在 UI Localization 任务上取得领先。235B 参数的 MoE 架构（22B 激活），专注视觉理解任务。— HuggingFace Blog\n\n• **Nemotron ColEmbed V2** — NVIDIA 发布多模态检索模型，登顶 ViDoRe V3 榜单。提升文档视觉检索能力，对 RAG 系统有实际价值。— HuggingFace Blog\n\n• **PersonaPlex-7B** — NVIDIA 开源全双工对话模型，MIT 协议。绕过传统 ASR→LLM→TTS 流水线，降低语音 AI 延迟。（7.6K likes）— @DataChaz\n\n## 🔧 DEV\n\n• **Transformers.js v4 Preview** — Hugging Face 发布预览版，现已上线 NPM。浏览器端推理能力再升级，前端 AI 应用开发更便捷。— HuggingFace Blog\n\n• **bitnet.cpp 开源** — Microsoft 开源 1-bit LLM 推理框架。100B 参数模型可纯 CPU 运行，推理速度提升 6.17x，能耗降低 82.2%。（20.6K likes）— @oliviscusAI\n\n• **GitHub Official MCP Server** — GitHub 官方 MCP 服务器发布，开源。可自动化 GitHub 工作流、分析仓库数据、构建与 GitHub 生态交互的 AI 工具。（3.1K likes）— @akshay_pachaar\n\n• **Agent Tracing 开放标准** — Cursor 提议追踪 Agent 对话到生成代码的开放标准，兼容任意 coding agent。解决 AI 生成代码的可追溯性问题。（2.7K likes）— @cursor_ai\n\n## 📱 APP\n\n• **Natively Adaptive Interfaces (NAI)** — Google 发布 AI 无障碍框架，让技术界面自适应用户需求。面向残障用户的包容性设计新范式。— Google AI Blog\n\n• **Gemini 超级碗广告** — Google 在 Big Game 期间投放 Gemini 广告，主题\"New Home\"。消费级 AI 助手的主流化营销信号。— Google AI Blog\n\n## 🚀 PRODUCT\n\n• **SyGra Studio** — ServiceNow AI 在 HuggingFace 发布。企业级 AI 工作流构建工具。— HuggingFace Blog\n\n• **TradingAgents** — 开源多 Agent LLM 交易框架（Python）。将 LLM 引入量化交易流程，值得关注其实际收益验证。（1K likes）— @quantscience_\n\n• **US Ski & Snowboard AI Tool** — Google Cloud 为美国滑雪队构建 AI 分析工具，备战 2026 冬奥会。体育 AI 应用的行业标杆案例。— Google AI Blog\n\n## 📝 TECHNIQUE\n\n• **Karpathy: 80% Agent Coding** — Andrej Karpathy 透露已从 80% 手动编码转向 80% Agent 编码，\"几周内发生的二十年来最大编程变革\"。预警 2026 年将是 \"slopocalypse\"（低质量代码泛滥之年）。（3.4K likes）— @AISafetyMemes\n\n## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY\n\n**什么是 1-bit LLM？** 传统大模型用 16 或 32 位浮点数存储参数，1-bit 模型将参数压缩到仅用 1 位（+1 或 -1）表示。这大幅缩小模型体积和计算量，使普通 CPU 也能运行百亿参数模型。代价是精度略有损失，但在许多任务上表现仍然可用。\n\n## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY\n\n**Microsoft bitnet.cpp 开源** — 20K+ 点赞不是没有原因。让 100B 模型在消费级硬件上运行，这不是渐进式优化，是架构层面的范式转移。如果 1-bit 量化被广泛采纳，GPU 短缺问题将被重新定义。\n\n→ https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet"
