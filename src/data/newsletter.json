  "markdown": "# Claude Code Lands in Xcode While GPT-5.2 Does Real Physics\n\nAnthropic and Apple shipped a native SDK integration that puts autonomous agents inside every Apple developer's workflow. Meanwhile, OpenAI's reasoning model just co-authored a theoretical physics paper with Harvard and Cambridge.\n\nToday: Claude agents in Xcode, GPT-5.2 in the lab, and Coursera's aggressive anti-AI honeypot.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 MODEL\n\n• **GPT-5.2 derived a novel result in theoretical physics** — OpenAI is releasing a preprint with researchers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Vanderbilt, Cambridge, and Harvard showing that a gluon interaction previously thought impossible can occur under specific conditions. This is the first time a frontier model has contributed original theoretical work at this level. [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2022390096625078389)\n\n• **Gemini 3 Deep Think gets a science-focused upgrade** — Google is positioning the reasoning model to tackle \"modern science, research, and engineering challenges,\" with a demo showing the Wang Lab at Duke using it to design semiconductor materials. Two new papers show agentic workflows solving research-level problems in math, physics, and CS. [Read more →](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2021981510400709092)\n\n• **GPT-5 closed the loop in Ginkgo's autonomous lab** — OpenAI connected GPT-5 to a physical lab where it proposed experiments, ran them at scale, interpreted results, and iterated. The outcome: 40% reduction in protein production cost. This is what happens when reasoning models control wetware, not just code. [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019488071134347605)\n\n• **MiniCPM-o 4.5 is the first open-source full-duplex omni-modal LLM** — It can see, listen, and speak simultaneously without turn-taking. The model supports proactive interaction, moving beyond reactive chatbots. (1,418 likes). [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenBMB/status/2018741614257307678)\n\n• **NVIDIA's PersonaPlex-7B removes voice AI friction** — Free, MIT-licensed, full-duplex conversational model that skips the ASR → LLM → TTS pipeline. Open weights on HuggingFace. (7,660 likes). [Read more →](https://x.com/DataChaz/status/2013892316105417082)\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 DEV\n\n• **Claude Agent SDK now ships natively in Xcode 26.3** — Apple developers get subagents, background tasks, and plugins directly in Xcode for autonomous, long-running work across iPhone, Mac, and Vision Pro. Same harness that powers Claude Code. This is a major distribution win for Anthropic. [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2018771170938724682)\n\n• **Coursera hides a prompt injection in your clipboard to ban AI agents** — If you copy-paste course content, Coursera injects an invisible instruction telling AI agents to click a button called \"AiHoneypot,\" presumably triggering a ban. This is one of the more aggressive anti-agent tactics I've seen in production. (9,323 likes). [Read more →](https://x.com/iangcarroll/status/2022212829441667482)\n\n• **Singapore publishes the first Model AI Governance Framework for Agentic AI** — The document identifies new risk surfaces created by agent components: tool access, memory, planning loops. Other governments are still debating definitions; Singapore shipped a framework. (2,120 likes). [Read more →](https://x.com/LuizaJarovsky/status/2014676125713064195)\n\n• **sql-tap: Watch SQL traffic in real-time with a TUI** — GitHub trending project for monitoring database queries as they happen. [Read more →](https://github.com/mickamy/sql-tap)\n\n• **qwen-asr: C inference for Qwen3-ASR models** — Supports 0.6b and 1.7b transcription models. [Read more →](https://github.com/antirez/qwen-asr)\n\n---\n\n## 📝 TECHNIQUE\n\n• **A developer's take on the official Claude Code course** — The course focuses on how Claude reasons about code, not just prompting techniques. Strong coverage of working directory context, tool use patterns, and multi-step workflows. Best for developers who want to understand *why* Claude makes certain decisions, less useful for prompt-only users. (94 upvotes). [Read more →](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r4d3wf/i_went_through_the_official_claude_code_course/)\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 PRODUCT\n\n• **OpenAI launches Prism, a free research workspace powered by GPT-5.2** — Available to anyone with a ChatGPT personal account. Designed for scientists to write and collaborate on research with full LaTeX project context. The demo shows GPT-5.2 working inside a paper with section-aware edits. [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2016209462621831448)\n\n• **Genie 3 powers Waymo's World Model** — Google's generative model creates photorealistic, interactive environments to train autonomous vehicles on rare edge cases before they happen in reality. [Read more →](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2019808426675843105)\n\n• **ChatGPT Atlas now supports tab groups** — [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2014095512874655867)\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY\n\n**What's a \"full-duplex\" conversational model?** Traditional voice AI uses a pipeline: your speech is transcribed (ASR), sent to an LLM, then synthesized back to audio (TTS). This forces rigid turn-taking — the model can't interrupt or respond while you're talking. Full-duplex models like MiniCPM-o 4.5 and PersonaPlex-7B process audio directly in both directions simultaneously, enabling natural interruptions and overlapping speech, just like human conversation.
