Server-side compaction automatically summarizes older parts of the conversation, preserving essential information while freeing up space for new context. This lets agents maintain coherent multi-hour sessions without losing track of what they're doing, a critical capability for autonomous coding and research tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY\n\n**OpenAI's Responses API primitives for long-running agents**\n\nThis is infrastructure, not a flashy demo—and that's why it matters. Server-side compaction and networked containers solve two of the hardest problems in deploying real autonomous agents: context limits and internet access. Combined with GPT-5.2 in deep research, OpenAI is clearly building toward agents that can work independently for hours. The agentic future just got more concrete.\n\n[Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2021286050623373500)"
