## 🏆 Cover Story: Anthropic Launches Claude Code Security — Cybersecurity Stocks Tank

Anthropic dropped a bombshell on Friday (2/20) with the release of **Claude Code Security** — an AI-powered code security scanner that automatically identifies vulnerabilities across codebases and generates human-reviewable patch suggestions. It's currently available as a limited research preview for Enterprise and Teams customers.

The market reaction was immediate and brutal. CrowdStrike, Okta, and other cybersecurity names sold off hard, with the cybersecurity ETF falling 3.8% in a single session. Wall Street's read is straightforward: when AI can automatically find *and* fix vulnerabilities, the value proposition of traditional security tooling starts to erode fast.

This also marks Anthropic's definitive shift from "model company" to "platform company." Claude Code's annualized revenue has crossed **$2.5 billion** and is still doubling. The side project that nobody planned for is now the company's biggest commercial engine.

## 🔥 This Week's Big Stories

### 1. Meta and NVIDIA Ink Massive Infrastructure Partnership (2/18)

Meta and NVIDIA announced a long-term strategic partnership to deploy **millions of Blackwell and Rubin GPUs** along with Grace CPUs across Meta's AI data centers. Meta's 2026 AI CapEx budget stands at a staggering **$115–135 billion**, with NVIDIA capturing the lion's share. This is the largest single-customer AI chip procurement deal ever signed — and it tells you everything about where Meta's strategic bets are headed.

### 2. India AI Impact Summit: The New Delhi Frontier AI Commitments (2/19)

Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Meta, and leading Indian AI companies co-signed the **New Delhi Frontier AI Commitments** — a voluntary framework pushing for inclusive and responsible development of frontier AI. The geopolitical dynamics were telling: the U.S. explicitly rejected any form of global AI governance, while China was absent entirely. India is positioning itself as the bridge between Western tech and the Global South, and this summit made the fault lines clearer than ever.

### 3. Meta Kills VR Metaverse — Horizon Worlds Goes Mobile-Only (2/20)

Meta's Horizon Worlds is pivoting from a VR + mobile hybrid to a **mobile-only platform**. A Reality Labs VP offered the usual "we're still committed to VR headsets" line, but the substance is unmistakable: the metaverse narrative is dead, replaced by AI as the company's core strategic thesis. Zuckerberg's $36 billion bet on virtual worlds is officially being written off in favor of AI infrastructure.

### Claude Sonnet 4.6 Becomes Anthropic's Default Model (2/17)

**Claude Sonnet 4.6** is now the default model for both free and Pro users, bringing across-the-board improvements in computer use, coding, design, and large-scale data processing. Anthropic simultaneously launched an expanded agentic tool suite and embedded Claude into **PowerPoint and Excel** for enterprise customers — a clear play for the Microsoft-dominated office productivity market.

### GPT-5.3-Codex Hits General Availability in GitHub Copilot (2/9 → GA This Week)

GPT-5.3-Codex is now generally available across GitHub Copilot, cementing OpenAI's position in the agentic coding race. Alongside the full release, OpenAI launched **GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark** — a lightweight variant with 128K context optimized for real-time coding assistance. The coding wars just got another front.

## 📣 X Highlights

**Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO)** publicly called out tech companies for using AI as a cover for mass layoffs: "You can't blame everything on AI." The statement sparked industry-wide debate — when AI tools genuinely are displacing workers, where exactly is the line between legitimate restructuring and convenient scapegoating?

**Bloomberg's deep dive** into the origin of Claude Code revealed it started as a side project by Anthropic engineer Boris Cherny — and became the company's runaway hit product. Even Dario Amodei didn't see it coming. It's a reminder that the most consequential products often emerge from the margins, not the roadmap.

## 🎯 Takeaway

1. **AI Is Eating the Security Industry** — Claude Code Security isn't the end; it's the beginning. When AI can autonomously discover and patch vulnerabilities, the entire value chain of traditional security tooling needs to be rethought.

2. **The Agentic Coding War Is Heating Up** — GPT-5.3-Codex vs. Claude Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6, with both camps shipping flagship coding models in the same week. Developer experience, not benchmark scores, will determine the winner.

3. **Meta's Strategic Pivot Is Complete** — $135B AI CapEx + killing the VR metaverse + the NVIDIA mega-deal. Zuckerberg is all-in on AI infrastructure, and the virtual worlds chapter is closed.

4. **AI Geopolitics Are Fracturing Fast** — The New Delhi summit laid it bare: the U.S. leads and refuses global governance, India jockeys for bridge status, China sits it out. "No global AI governance" will be the defining narrative of 2026.

5. **Anthropic's Brand Play Is Sharp** — Super Bowl ad + refusing military applications + "Claude will never run ads." While OpenAI accelerates commercialization, Anthropic is playing the trust card — and it's working.
