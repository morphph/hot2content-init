## 🏆 Cover Story: Vibe Coding Turns One — From Meme to a $45B Industry

A year ago, Andrej Karpathy fired off a casual tweet and coined "vibe coding." Fast forward to today: Collins Dictionary named it 2025's Word of the Year, and the platforms built around it are collectively valued at **$45 billion** — Cursor at $29.3B, Lovable at $6.6B, Replit reportedly approaching $9B.

But last week, Karpathy tried to kill his own creation. He posted on X proposing **"Agentic Engineering"** as a replacement, arguing that what started as vibes has matured into a real engineering discipline — "with art, science, and professional standards." The community largely shrugged and kept saying vibe coding.

Meanwhile, the security story is getting ugly. A BBC journalist's laptop was hijacked via a zero-click attack through **Orchids**, a vibe coding platform. Wix's **Base44** exposed enterprise auth vulnerabilities. And total security investment across the entire vibe coding ecosystem? A measly **$27M** — a rounding error on $45B in valuations.

> 🔗 [NYT: The A.I. Disruption Has Arrived, and It Sure Is Fun](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/opinion/ai-software.html)

**Takeaway for indie builders:** Security can't be an afterthought. If you're shipping user-facing products on Lovable, Bolt, or Replit, invest the time in a security audit. Your users shouldn't pay the price for your vibes.

## 💰 Revenue Milestones

### From $49 to $19: How One Founder Went from 8 Customers to 240

The hottest post on r/SaaS this week: a solo founder shared their pricing pivot story. At $49/month they had 8 customers ($392 MRR). They gritted their teeth, dropped to $19/month, and within five months hit 240 customers (**$4,560 MRR**) — an 11x revenue jump.

The key insight isn't just the math. 240 low-price customers = 240 potential referrers. Word-of-mouth compounds way faster with volume than it does with a handful of premium users.

### Distribution Beats Product — Every Time

Another hit post analyzed 19 Starter Story founder interviews ($10K–$200K+ MRR) and found the #1 pattern: **distribution capability matters more than product quality**. The best product with no distribution loses to a decent product with great distribution. Every. Single. Time.

## 🛠 Build Story

### Glippy — "Lighthouse, But for AI Readability"

An indie dev is building **Glippy** in public on r/buildinpublic — a Chrome extension that checks whether your website is AI-agent and LLM-crawler friendly (GEO readiness). It now runs 80+ checks and has a demo video.

This is a smart niche play. As AI-powered search goes mainstream, "Can AI actually read your site?" is becoming every webmaster's new headache. Think of it as the SEO audit tool for the post-Google era.

### A Product Manager Built 13 Projects with Claude Code

A PM wrote up their experience building 13 projects with **Claude Code** over the past six months on Medium. It's the PM-to-builder pipeline in action — and it's a pattern we're seeing more and more. The people closest to the problem are now building the solution directly, no engineering team required.

## ⚡ Stack Watch

### Cursor Ships Long-Running Agents

On February 12, Cursor officially launched **Long-Running Agents** (cursor.com/agents), available for Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise users. These agents can autonomously tackle larger tasks, produce more complete PRs, and dramatically reduce the back-and-forth editing cycle that plagues current AI coding workflows.

Also shipping: **Composer 1.5** and **Subagents** (parallel task execution). Cursor is quietly building the most complete agentic coding stack on the market.

### The Case for Spec-Driven Development Over Vibe Coding

An important piece from The New Stack argues that vibe coding needs an upgrade: replace pure prompting with **spec-driven development**. Write the spec first, then let the AI execute. It's the difference between hoping the AI reads your mind and giving it a blueprint. For anyone shipping production code with AI, this is required reading.

### Product Hunt Orbit Awards: AI Automation Category Open for Nominations

Product Hunt's **Orbit Awards** are accepting nominations in the AI Automation category. If you've built an AI workflow tool, now's the time to throw your hat in the ring.

## 📣 X Highlights & Community

### "Build in Public Is Creating a Generation of Fake Businesses"

A scorching debate erupted on r/SaaS: too many devs are trapped in Twitter's dopamine loop, shipping $15/month AI wrappers to other techies. The math is brutal — to hit $10K MRR at that price, you need 666 paying customers and have to fight churn every single day. The post is a wake-up call for anyone confusing social media engagement with actual business traction.

### HN: Is AI the Final Nail in the Coffin for Solo Developers?

A Hacker News thread explored the existential question: when AI lets anyone build an app, does the solo developer's side project still have a business case? The top comments are surprisingly optimistic — arguing that taste, distribution, and domain expertise still matter more than raw building ability.

### Solo Dev Building an AI-Powered D&D Game in Public

An indie developer started building **The SoloQuest** — an AI-driven D&D game — in public on DEV.to. Going from silent building to public building. Worth following if you're into the intersection of AI and gaming.

## 📊 Trend Signals

1. **"Agentic Engineering" Is Replacing "Vibe Coding"** — Karpathy's rebranding attempt reflects the industry's shift from experimentation to engineering rigor. Cursor's long-running agents and subagents are the proof point.

2. **Security Is Vibe Coding's Achilles Heel** — $45B in platform valuations vs. $27M in security investment. The BBC zero-click attack may be the wake-up call the industry needs. There's a massive startup opportunity here.

3. **Pricing Strategy > Product Features** — Multiple Reddit case studies confirm: lower price + volume beats high price + few customers, especially in the hyper-competitive AI SaaS space.

4. **The PM-to-Builder Pipeline Is Real** — More PMs are shipping products directly with Claude Code and Cursor, skipping the PRD-to-engineering handoff entirely.

5. **GEO Is the New SEO** — AI search is changing how traffic flows. "Is your site AI-readable?" is the new "Is your site Google-friendly?" Tools like Glippy are the early movers.

## 🎯 Takeaway

The quote of the week comes from the NYT op-ed:

> *"I could teach you now to make a complex web app in a few weeks. In about six months you could do a lot of things that took me 20 years to learn."*

Vibe coding is one year old. It went from a meme to a $45 billion industry. But with Karpathy pushing to rebrand it as "agentic engineering," the signal is clear: **the toy phase is over. The engineering phase has begun.**

What this means for indie builders:
- 🛡️ **Security is not optional** — Every vibe-coded product you ship needs a security audit
- 💰 **Test pricing aggressively** — Don't get trapped by "premium positioning." Volume might be your answer
- 📐 **From vibes to specs** — Spec-driven development with AI agents produces dramatically better output
- 🔍 **Pay attention to GEO** — Your SEO strategy needs an AI-readability layer

See you next week 👋
