## 📝 TECHNIQUE

• **Karpathy: "80% agent coding, 20% edits" is the new normal** — @AISafetyMemes
Andrej Karpathy reports flipping from 80% manual coding to 80% agent-assisted in weeks, calling it "the biggest change in ~2 decades of programming." He warns 2026 may be "the year of slopocalypse" as low-quality AI-generated code proliferates. (3.4K likes)

## 🚀 PRODUCT

• **TradingAgents: Multi-agent LLM trading framework** — @quantscience_
Open-source Python framework for building AI trading systems with multiple specialized agents. Combines LLM reasoning with financial workflows. (1K likes)

• **ServiceNow launches SyGra Studio** — HuggingFace Blog
New tool for building synthetic data generation pipelines. Enterprise AI teams can now create training data more systematically.

• **Google's Natively Adaptive Interfaces (NAI) framework** — Google AI Blog
AI-powered accessibility framework that makes technology dynamically adapt to users' needs. Moves beyond static accessibility features toward truly inclusive design.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "1-bit" inference?** Traditional neural networks store weights as 16 or 32-bit floating point numbers. 1-bit quantization compresses weights to just two values (-1 or +1), dramatically reducing memory and compute requirements. The tradeoff is slight accuracy loss, but BitNet research shows 100B models can run acceptably on consumer CPUs. This matters because it shifts the hardware bottleneck from expensive GPUs to ubiquitous processors.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Microsoft's BitNet.cpp open-source release** fundamentally changes who can run large language models. A 100B parameter model on CPU without specialized hardware means startups, researchers, and hobbyists can experiment with frontier-scale models on commodity machines. Combined with 82% energy savings, this could reshape the economics of AI deployment — and weaken NVIDIA's grip on the inference market.
