## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is a "constitution" for an AI model?**

Anthropic published Claude's new constitution—a detailed document describing the model's intended behavior and values. Unlike training data, a constitution is written primarily *for* the AI itself and used directly during training. It's essentially an instruction manual that shapes how the model reasons about ethics, safety, and helpfulness, making AI behavior more transparent and auditable than black-box training approaches.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Claude will remain ad-free** — @claudeai

While OpenAI announced ads coming to ChatGPT's free tier (12.7K engagement), Anthropic took a firm stance: advertising is "incompatible" with Claude's vision as a thinking assistant. This philosophical split matters—it signals fundamentally different product visions. One company sees AI as an ad-supported platform; the other sees it as a premium tool where user trust is paramount. Your choice of AI assistant is increasingly a choice about what kind of future you're voting for. (59K + 14.4K engagement combined)
