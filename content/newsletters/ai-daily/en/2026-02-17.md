# AI Daily Digest — Feb 17, 2026

## 🧠 MODEL — New Releases & Trending Open-Source

- **NVIDIA PersonaPlex 7B v1** — Surging on HuggingFace (1,964 ❤️). Persona-driven 7B model from NVIDIA, likely for character/role-based generation.
- **GLM-5** (Zhipu AI) — Still trending strong at 1,306 ❤️. China's flagship LLM competitor.
- **Kimi-K2.5** (Moonshot AI) — Holding at 2,222 ❤️ as the most-liked model this week.
- **Qwen3-Coder-Next** — Qwen's coding variant at 904 ❤️. Competing directly with GPT-5.3-Codex.
- **NVIDIA Nemotron 2 Nano 9B Japanese** (HF blog, Feb 17) — Sovereign AI: a small but capable Japanese-optimized model. Signals the "localized LLM" trend.
- **Ace-Step 1.5** (Step Fun) — Text-to-audio model (565 ❤️). Music/audio generation getting more competitive.
- **Anima** (Circlestone Labs) — 617 ❤️, 145K downloads. Under-the-radar model gaining traction.

## 📱 APP — Consumer Updates

- **Figma × Claude Code integration** — Figma shipped the ability to bring UI work done in Claude Code straight into Figma as editable design frames. Designers and devs now share a real bridge.
- **Claude Code turns 1** — Birthday party in SF. The team is celebrating with the community. WAU still doubling.
- **Suno v5 generates riddim dubstep** — Combined with Claude Code for rave visuals. AI music just got weirder (and better).
- **ChatGPT ads rolling out** — OpenAI testing ads for Free and Go users. The monetization era begins.

## 🔧 DEV — Developer Tools, APIs, SDKs

- **ASCII wireframe → code pipeline** — A dev built a tool to draw wireframes in ASCII, then feed them to AI agents as markdown. Agents parse layouts better from structured text than screenshots.
- **Claude Code on Mercor's job marketplace** — Unleashing Claude Code on real marketplace data for automation.
- **Claude Code Boris (core dev) shares workflow** — Minimal customization, focus on parallel task execution, team knowledge sharing. Key insight: "Claude Code works great out of the box."

## 📝 TECHNIQUE — Coding Practices & Prompting Tips

- **"AI agents read markdown better than they read your mind"** — Trending take on X. The practice of feeding structured markdown/ASCII wireframes to coding agents instead of vague descriptions is gaining momentum.
- **Complete Claude Code mastery guide** — Multiple viral threads pointing to comprehensive guides. Non-programmers writing Claude Code usage guides that are surprisingly good.
- **How Anthropic's marketing team uses Claude Code** — Non-engineering teams adopting coding agents. Pattern: define the task in markdown, let the agent execute.
- **Custom CUDA Kernels from Codex and Claude** (HF, Feb 13) — Still trending. AI agents writing GPU kernels is becoming real, not just a demo.

## 🚀 PRODUCT — New Products & Agents

- **Step-3.5-Flash** (Step Fun) — 620 ❤️, 288K downloads. Fast inference model from Chinese lab.
- **inclusionAI Ring-2.5-1T** — A 1 trillion parameter model (190 ❤️). The parameter race continues.
- **MiniCPM-SALA** (OpenBMB) — 457 ❤️. Compact multimodal model with strong efficiency.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Design Frames (Figma ↔ Code)

**What just happened with Figma + Claude Code?** Traditionally, designers create in Figma, then devs rebuild everything in code — a lossy handoff. Now Figma lets you take code-generated UI (from Claude Code) and import it directly into Figma as editable design frames. This means: a developer can describe a UI to Claude Code, get working React components, and push those back into Figma where designers can tweak them visually. The design↔code gap just got a lot smaller. It's bidirectional now.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: "AI Agents Read Markdown"

The hottest dev technique right now is deceptively simple: instead of describing what you want in natural language, give AI coding agents structured input — ASCII wireframes, markdown specs, or even tables. Multiple viral posts show that agents parse structured text far more reliably than prose. One dev built an ASCII wireframe editor that produces layouts in 30 seconds, which agents then convert to pixel-perfect code. The lesson: the better your *input format*, the better your *output quality*. Think of it as "context engineering" for coding agents — and it's becoming a must-have skill.
