# Sonnet 4.6 Dominates Claude Code as Massive MoE Models Go Open-Source

**February 19, 2026**

Sonnet 4.6 continues to impress in Claude Code — devs are choosing it over Opus for the speed-capability balance. On the open-source front, Qwen drops a 397B MoE monster while NVIDIA's PersonaPlex goes viral. The model landscape is evolving fast.

- **Bun: `bun build --compile --target=browser`** — Bundles & compiles to browser target (from Jarred Sumner).

## 📝 TECHNIQUE — Practices & Insights

- **Anthropic: Quantifying infrastructure noise in coding evals** — Infrastructure config can swing benchmarks by several percentage points, sometimes more than the gap between top models. Important for anyone running evals.
- **Anthropic: Measuring AI agent autonomy in practice** — New research on how to measure real-world agent autonomy.
- **Custom CUDA Kernels from Codex & Claude** — HuggingFace blog (57 ❤️) on using AI agents to write CUDA kernels. Related: teaching open models to do the same (138 ❤️).
- **MCP server in 28 lines of code** — Matt Pocock's minimal MCP server tutorial. Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Zed.
- **Claude Code turns 1** — Now writes 4% of all GitHub commits, DAU doubled last month. Spotify CEO endorsed it in earnings call; best devs "haven't written a single line of code since."
- **SSH support for Claude Code on Desktop** — Connect to remote machines.
- **IBM & UC Berkeley: IT-Bench and MAST** — Diagnosing why enterprise agents fail.

## 🚀 PRODUCT — New Products & Agents

- **Google Jules** — Google's coding agent, reportedly more user-friendly than OpenAI Codex.
- **Dreamer launch** — Backed by Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger.
- **Better Agents** — Open-source project to supercharge coding assistants.
- **MCP server directory** — 2,617 MCP servers catalogued at one site.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: What is "Infrastructure Noise" in AI Benchmarks?

When we compare AI models on coding benchmarks like SWE-bench, the scores seem objective. But Anthropic's new research shows that **infrastructure configuration** — things like timeout settings, retry logic, container specs, and network conditions — can swing results by several percentage points. That's often **bigger than the gap between "1st place" and "3rd place"** on leaderboards.

This means: don't over-index on small benchmark differences between models. A 2% gap might just be how the test was set up, not actual model capability. When evaluating models for your use case, run your own evals in your own environment.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: Automatic Prompt Caching on Anthropic API

Anthropic quietly shipped **automatic prompt caching** — no code changes needed. If you're making repeated API calls with similar system prompts or long context, your costs just dropped and latency improved without touching a line of code. This is the kind of infrastructure improvement that compounds: every API user benefits immediately. If you're building with Claude's API, check your usage dashboard — you might already be saving money.
