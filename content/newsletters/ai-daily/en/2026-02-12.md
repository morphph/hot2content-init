## 📝 TECHNIQUE

**Quantifying infrastructure noise in agentic coding evals** (Featured on Anthropic Engineering) — Infrastructure config can swing benchmark scores by several percentage points — sometimes more than the gap between top models. Leaderboard skeptics, this is your ammunition.
⚡ Action: Read before making model decisions based on benchmarks

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What are "Skills" in the agent context?** When OpenAI says "Skills" in their Responses API, they mean packaged capabilities an agent can invoke — like browsing the web, running code, or calling external APIs. Think of them as plug-and-play abilities. Vercel also built skills.sh, a directory where you can install skills for coding agents. The trend: agents are becoming modular, with capabilities you can mix and match rather than being locked to what one model can do.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Kimi K2.5** — This is the most interesting model drop this week. Open-weights, beats Opus 4.5 on most benchmarks, priced at Flash tier, and Moonshot is building real tooling around it (CLI, web app, slides). If you've been defaulting to Claude or GPT for everything, this is worth a test drive. The open-weights angle means you can actually run it locally.
