## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Mixture of Experts (MoE)
Qwen's new 397B model only activates 17B parameters per query — that's **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**. Instead of running all 397B parameters, the model routes each input to a small subset of specialized "expert" sub-networks. Result: you get the quality of a huge model with the speed and cost of a small one. It's why models keep getting "bigger" on paper but don't get proportionally slower.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: GGML joins Hugging Face
The creator of GGML (the engine behind llama.cpp that made local LLM inference possible) is joining Hugging Face. This is significant because llama.cpp is the backbone of nearly every local AI deployment — from Ollama to LM Studio to countless apps. Having it backed by HF's resources means faster development, better integration, and a stronger future for running AI on your own hardware. If you care about local AI, this is the most important news of the week. [Read more](https://huggingface.co/blog/ggml-joins-hf)
