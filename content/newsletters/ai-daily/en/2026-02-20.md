## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Prompt Caching

**What it is:** When you send a request to an LLM API, the system can cache the beginning of your request (the "prefix"). If your next request starts the same way, it reuses that cached computation instead of re-processing everything.

**Why it matters:** For agents like Claude Code that send dozens of API calls in one session, each call shares the same system prompt + tools + conversation history. Without caching, every call re-processes all of that from scratch. With caching, only the new part costs full price.

**The key insight:** It's a prefix match — everything must be identical from the start. Change one character in your system prompt? Cache miss. Reorder your tools? Cache miss. That's why Anthropic just launched automatic prompt caching — so you don't have to think about cache breakpoints anymore.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: Claude Code Security

Anthropic launched a security scanner built into Claude Code that finds vulnerabilities in your codebase and suggests patches for human review. This is significant because:

1. **It's proactive** — scans your code without you asking
2. **It's agentic** — doesn't just flag issues, it writes fix patches
3. **It's the security story** — as AI writes more code, AI also needs to audit more code

With 22K likes, it's the most-engaged AI tweet today. Currently in research preview for Team and Enterprise plans. Worth watching as this could become the default way codebases get security-audited.
