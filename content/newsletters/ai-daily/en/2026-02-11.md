**February 11, 2026**

## 🧠 MODEL

- **Claude Opus 4.6 released** (Anthropic) — Plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks longer, catches its own mistakes. A 2.5x-faster version is now available as an early experiment via Claude Code and API.

- **GPT-5.2 & GPT-5.2-Codex ~40% faster** (OpenAI) — Inference stack optimized for API customers. Same weights, much faster. Codex variant optimized for agentic coding.

- **GPT-5.3-Codex in Codex** (OpenAI) — Latest coding model now available in the Codex IDE. "You can just build things."

- **Kimi-K2.5** (Moonshot AI) — Trending on HuggingFace with 2K+ likes. Multimodal image-text-to-text model.

- **Qwen3-Coder-Next** (Qwen) — New code-focused model trending on HuggingFace (777♥). GGUF quants already available via Unsloth.

- **MiniCPM-o-4.5** (OpenBMB) — Any-to-any multimodal model, 787♥ on HuggingFace.

- **Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime** (Mistral) — Tiny 4B real-time speech recognition model. Mistral pushing into voice.

- **Gemini Deep Think** (DeepMind) — New research on accelerating math and scientific discovery with deeper reasoning.

## 📱 APP

- **Claude Cowork launched** (Anthropic) — Non-technical task completion, like Claude Code but for everything else. Now on Pro plans, also available on Windows with full feature parity.

- **Claude in Excel** (Anthropic) — Now on Pro plans. Handles multiple files via drag-and-drop, avoids overwriting cells, auto-compaction for long sessions.

- **Claude health integrations** (Anthropic) — Apple Health, Health Connect, HealthEx, and Function Health now in beta. AI meets your fitness data.

- **OpenAI Prism** (OpenAI) — Free workspace for scientists to write and collaborate on research, powered by GPT-5.2. Available to all ChatGPT accounts.

- **Codex app for macOS** (OpenAI) — Command center for building with coding agents. Now available on Mac.

## 🔧 DEV

- **Xcode + Claude Agent SDK** (Anthropic + Apple) — Direct integration gives iOS/Mac/Vision Pro developers full Claude Code functionality in Xcode.

- **OpenAI Skills API** (OpenAI) — New Skills support in Responses API with local and hosted container execution. Plus a new Hosted Shell tool with networking.

- **Batch API for GPT Image models** (OpenAI) — gpt-image-1.5, gpt-image-1, gpt-image-1-mini now supported in Batch API.

- **VS Code extension for Claude Code GA** (Anthropic) — @-mention files, slash commands, closer to CLI experience.

- **Interactive work tool integrations** (Anthropic) — Draft Slack messages, Figma diagrams, Asana timelines directly in Claude.

- **Transformers.js v4 Preview** (HuggingFace) — Now on NPM. Run ML models in the browser.

## 📝 TECHNIQUE

- **Quantifying infrastructure noise in agentic evals** (Anthropic Engineering) — Infrastructure config can swing benchmarks by several percentage points—sometimes more than the gap between top models. Stop trusting leaderboard deltas blindly.

- **Building a C compiler with parallel Claudes** (Anthropic Engineering) — Agent teams built a C compiler that compiles the Linux kernel. Two weeks, mostly autonomous. Blueprint for multi-agent development.

- **AI assistance hurts skill formation** (Anthropic Research) — Experiment with software engineers showed coding with AI led to decreased skill development. Important signal for how we use these tools.

- **Claude-Mem for persistent memory** (Community) — Trending tool giving Claude Code persistent memory across sessions. Solves the "amnesia" problem.

- **300+ MCP servers collection** (Community) — Open-source collection of MCP servers. The MCP ecosystem is exploding.

## 🚀 PRODUCT

- **Claude free plan upgrade** (Anthropic) — Free users can now create/edit files, use skills, and compaction. Significant expansion.

- **Anthropic: no ads, ever** (Anthropic) — Explicit commitment that Claude will remain ad-free. "Advertising would be incompatible with that vision."

- **Anthropic invests $1.5M in Python Software Foundation** (Anthropic) — Supporting open-source security for the language that powers AI.

- **Mars rover AI-planned drive** (Anthropic) — Perseverance rover's Dec 8 drive was the first AI-planned drive on another planet, planned by Claude.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "inference speed" and why does it matter?** When you chat with an AI, the model has to "think" through billions of calculations to generate each word. Inference speed is how fast it does this. OpenAI just made GPT-5.2 40% faster without changing the model itself—they optimized the computing infrastructure. Faster inference means lower costs, snappier responses, and the ability to tackle longer, more complex tasks without timing out.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic's C Compiler built by agent teams.** Anthropic tasked Opus 4.6 agent teams to build a C compiler from scratch—then mostly walked away. Two weeks later, it compiled the Linux kernel. This is the clearest demonstration yet that multi-agent systems can tackle real, complex engineering projects autonomously. → https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler
