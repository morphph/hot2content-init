## 📝 TECHNIQUE

**Spotify shipping entirely with Claude Code** — Their best developers haven't written a single line of code since adopting it. A real enterprise case study of full agentic coding adoption.

**28 Days of Claude API — Day 13: Agent Skills** — Tutorial series covering how Claude learns new capabilities at runtime via Skills. Skills are folders with SKILL.md files that agents read and follow.

**obra/superpowers methodology gaining traction** — Jesse Vincent's "discipline over intelligence" approach to coding agents keeps spreading. Core idea: encode best practices as mandatory skills, not optional suggestions. Brainstorm → Plan → TDD → Subagent execution.

## 🚀 PRODUCT

**OpenAI Skills in Responses API** (Feb 10) — Now supports both local and hosted container-based execution. Plus new Hosted Shell tool with networking. OpenAI, Anthropic, and the community are all converging on "skills" as the standard unit of agent capability.

**Agent Skills ecosystem exploding** — openai/skills, anthropic/claude-plugins-official, vercel-labs/skills, and 800+ community skills in awesome-skills collections. This week made it clear: skills/plugins are the app store of the agent era.

**Tencent HunyuanImage 3.0 Instruct** (351 ❤️) — Tencent's latest image generation model, instruction-following focused.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: What are "Agent Skills"?

A **Skill** is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file that teaches an AI agent how to do something specific. Think of it like a recipe card — the agent reads it and follows the instructions.

Example: a "GitHub" skill tells the agent how to use `gh` CLI commands. A "weather" skill tells it how to fetch forecasts.

Why it matters now: OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel, and hundreds of community developers all converged on this same pattern this week. Skills are becoming the **standard unit of agent capability** — like apps were for smartphones. The agent that can load the right skill at the right time wins.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: The Skills Convergence

This week's biggest signal isn't any single product — it's that **everyone independently arrived at the same answer**:

- **OpenAI**: launched Skills in Responses API
- **Anthropic**: shipped claude-plugins-official + knowledge-work-plugins
- **Vercel**: released vercel-labs/skills
- **Community**: 800+ skills in curated collections
- **obra/superpowers**: proved skills + discipline = autonomous agents that work for hours

We're watching the "app store moment" for AI agents happen in real time. The companies and developers building the best skills infrastructure will define the next platform.
