## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "Plan Mode" in AI coding agents?**
When you give an AI coding agent a complex task, it can either dive straight in (risky — might go the wrong direction) or pause to think first. Plan Mode is the second approach: the agent analyzes your request, asks clarifying questions, and presents an implementation plan with options before writing any code. Anthropic just shipped this in Claude Code's Slack app. It's the same principle behind good human engineering — measure twice, cut once. This reduces wasted work and gives you a chance to correct course before the agent spends tokens going down the wrong path.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Spotify ships entirely via Claude Code** — Boris Cherny (@bcherny) shared that Spotify's top developers haven't written a line of code since December, using Claude Code and internal AI tools instead. This isn't a demo or a weekend hack — it's a major tech company's production engineering workflow. Combined with NVIDIA deploying Codex to 30,000 engineers, we're seeing the first wave of enterprise-scale AI-native development. The question isn't whether AI coding tools work anymore — it's how fast every engineering org will adopt them.
