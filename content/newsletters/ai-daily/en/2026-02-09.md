## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Full-Duplex Conversational AI

Traditional voice AI uses a rigid pipeline: Speech Recognition → LLM → Text-to-Speech. Each component waits its turn — you talk, it processes, it responds. It works but feels robotic.

**Full-duplex** models like NVIDIA's PersonaPlex-7B break this pattern. They can listen and speak *at the same time*, using a dual-stream transformer that processes audio tokens continuously. This enables natural back-channel responses ("uh-huh", "right"), graceful interruptions, and real conversational rhythm — the same way humans actually talk.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: Anthropic's C Compiler Built by Agent Teams

Anthropic tasked Opus 4.6 agent teams to build a C compiler from scratch, then stepped back. The post details how multiple Claude agents coordinated autonomously over two weeks. This is arguably the most impressive public demonstration of multi-agent AI engineering to date — and it's directly relevant if you're thinking about how AI teams will work in production.
