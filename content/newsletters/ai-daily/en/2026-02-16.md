## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Skills & Agent Specifications

**What are "Skills" in coding agents?** Both OpenAI (Codex) and Anthropic (Claude Code) now support "Skills" — reusable, shareable instruction sets that tell a coding agent *how* to perform specific tasks. Think of them like plugins or recipes: instead of explaining your project setup every time, you write a SKILL.md once, and the agent follows it. OpenAI just launched Skills in their Responses API (Feb 10), supporting both local and hosted execution. This mirrors Claude Code's existing AgentSkills system. The convergence means: portable expertise that works across agents is becoming a standard pattern.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: Infrastructure Noise in Agentic Evals

Anthropic's engineering team published a deep investigation showing that **infrastructure configuration alone can swing benchmark results by several percentage points** — sometimes more than the actual gap between top models on leaderboards. This matters because the industry is making billion-dollar decisions based on these benchmarks. If your Docker config or network timeout settings affect scores more than model quality, what are we actually measuring? Essential reading for anyone building, evaluating, or buying AI coding tools.
