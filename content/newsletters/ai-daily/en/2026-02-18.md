## 📱 APP

**Claude Code adoption is exploding** — Anthropic reports weekly active users doubled since January. Spotify's best devs haven't written code by hand since December — all through Claude Code. Non-engineers are building with it too. Anthropic's $30B raise was partly driven by Claude Code growth.

**Google DeepMind: Gemini makes music** — New creative capability for Gemini to generate music. Also launched Gemini 3 Deep Think for advancing scientific research.

## 🔧 DEV

**OpenAI Skills in Responses API** (Feb 10) — Skills now work across local and hosted container execution. Also launched a new Hosted Shell tool with networking support in containers.

**OpenAI Batch API for Images** — gpt-image-1.5 and variants now supported in Batch API.

**Custom CUDA Kernels from Codex & Claude** (HuggingFace blog) — Agents can now write custom CUDA kernels. Huge for performance optimization workflows.

**Anthropic: Quantifying Infrastructure Noise in Agentic Evals** — Infrastructure config can swing coding benchmarks by several percentage points. Important read if you're evaluating coding agents.

## 📝 TECHNIQUE

**IBM + UC Berkeley: IT-Bench and MAST** — New framework to diagnose why enterprise AI agents fail. Uses structured evaluation to pinpoint failure modes.

**Gradio gr.HTML: One-Shot Web Apps** — Build any web app in one shot with Gradio's new HTML component. Quick prototyping superpower.

**Erik Schluntz's Claude Code Control Panel** — Physical keypad for vibe coding: Accept button, "It's broken" button, auto-accept toggle. Pre-orders open. Peak vibe coding culture.

## 🚀 PRODUCT

**Microsoft open-sourced bitnet.cpp** — 1-bit LLM inference framework. Run large models on CPU efficiently. Potential game-changer for edge deployment.

**OpenEnv: Evaluating Tool-Using Agents** — Real-world environment benchmarks for agents, from the Turing team.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

Qwen3.5-397B-A17B uses MoE — what does that mean?

A regular model activates ALL its parameters for every token. A MoE model has many "expert" sub-networks but only activates a few for each token. Qwen3.5 has 397B total parameters but only uses 17B per token (the "A17B" part).

**Why it matters:** You get the knowledge of a 397B model at the compute cost of a 17B model. It's like having 20 specialists on call but only consulting 2-3 per question.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: Sonnet 4.6 in Claude Code

The real story isn't just another model release — it's the adoption curve. Anthropic's Claude Code WAU doubled since January. Spotify engineers stopped writing code manually. Non-technical teams are building internal tools. And now Sonnet 4.6 makes this cheaper and faster.

If you haven't tried Claude Code yet, today's the day. If you have, switch to Sonnet 4.6 and see if it handles your workflows at a fraction of the Opus cost.
