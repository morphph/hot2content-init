## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: What is "Any-to-Any" Multimodal?

Models like MiniCPM-o-4.5 are labeled "any-to-any" — meaning they can accept **any** input modality (text, image, audio, video) and produce **any** output modality. Unlike traditional models that are text-in/text-out, or even vision models that are image-in/text-out, any-to-any models handle the full matrix of conversions. Think of it as the difference between a translator who only does English→French vs. one who handles any language pair. The practical impact: one model replaces an entire pipeline of specialized models, reducing latency and integration complexity.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: Claude Code Hits 4% of GitHub Commits

The most consequential data point today: **Claude Code now authors 4% of all public GitHub commits.** This isn't hype — it's measurable infrastructure adoption at a scale that changes how we think about developer productivity tools. Combined with the C compiler demo (agent teams building a compiler with minimal human input), Opus 4.6 fast mode, and agent swarms, Anthropic is making a play to be the default coding infrastructure layer. The question isn't whether AI-assisted coding will dominate — it's whether the 4% becomes 40% in 12 months.
