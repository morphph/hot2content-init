# Anthropic's Take-Home Test Falls to Its Own AI While OpenAI Embraces Ads

Anthropic's performance engineering candidates used to face a notoriously difficult take-home exam. Then Opus 4.5 beat it. Meanwhile, OpenAI is explaining its new ad strategy on a podcast—because nothing says "AI for humanity" quite like monetization.

Today: Opus outsmarts its creators, Cline CLI goes parallel, and a $10 RISC-V board runs a full AI assistant.

## 🧠 MODEL

• **Opus 4.5 defeats Anthropic's own hiring test** — The irony is delicious: Anthropic designed a notoriously difficult take-home exam for performance engineering candidates, and their flagship model just beat it. They've now had to redesign the test. When your AI is too good for your own interview process, that's either a flex or a problem. — @AnthropicAI [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2014143403144200234)

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is FP4 quantization?** Models are typically trained and stored in FP16 (16-bit floating point) or FP32 (32-bit). FP4 means compressing the model to just 4-bit precision—each weight takes up 4x less memory than FP16. The tradeoff is accuracy loss, but modern quantization techniques have gotten remarkably good at preserving model quality. When NVIDIA mentions FP4 *pre-training* for Nemotron 3, that's unusual—most quantization happens after training. If they've cracked FP4 pre-training, it could mean training larger models on smaller hardware.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Smart sleep mask broadcasts brainwaves to open MQTT broker** — A Kickstarter backer reverse-engineered their smart sleep mask and discovered it sends users' brainwave data to an unprotected MQTT broker—and accepts commands to send electrical impulses back. This isn't an AI story per se, but it's a perfect case study in why IoT + AI devices need security audits before they touch your brain.

**Industry note:** IBM is tripling entry-level hiring after finding limits to AI adoption (110 points on HN). Meanwhile, Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman gives white-collar automation 18 months. The disconnect between "AI will replace everyone" and "we need more humans" continues.
