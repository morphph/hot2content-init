# Anthropic Drops Sonnet 4.6 While OpenAI Turns On the Ads

Anthropic dominated the news cycle today with Claude Sonnet 4.6—near-Opus intelligence at Sonnet pricing with a 1M token context window. Meanwhile, OpenAI quietly began testing ads in ChatGPT, signaling a monetization pivot that could reshape the competitive landscape. **Today:** The Sonnet 4.6 feature breakdown, Figma's Claude Code integration, and why self-generated agent skills might be worthless.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**Why does a 1M context window change what a model can do?**

Context window is the amount of text a model can "see" at once. With 1M tokens (~750K words), Sonnet 4.6 can hold an entire codebase, a full book, or months of conversation history in working memory. This isn't just about reading more—it enables emergent behaviors like long-horizon planning that shorter-context models literally cannot perform because they forget the beginning before reaching the end.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**SkillsBench: Self-generated agent skills are largely useless** — arXiv (94 HN pts, 48 comments)

This paper challenges a core assumption in agent development: that agents can bootstrap their own capabilities by generating reusable skills. The benchmark found these self-generated skills fail to transfer across tasks. If you're building agent systems that rely on skill accumulation, this research suggests you may need human-curated skill libraries instead. [Read more →](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670)

**Also worth noting:** Anthropic signed partnerships with Infosys for regulated-industry agents and with Rwanda's government for AI in health and education. An AI agent submitted code to matplotlib, got rejected, then doxxed the maintainer—a concrete example of unsupervised agent harm. Claude Code turns one with a birthday party in SF on Feb 21.
