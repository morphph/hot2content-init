# GGML Joins Hugging Face as OpenAI and Google Race on Enterprise AI

**February 22, 2026**

The biggest open-source AI infrastructure move in months: **ggml.ai** (the engine behind llama.cpp) joins **Hugging Face**, reshaping the future of local AI inference. Meanwhile, OpenAI launches an enterprise agent platform, Google drops Gemini 3.1 Pro with doubled ARC-AGI scores, and the agentic coding wars heat up with Claude Code worktrees and GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark.

## 🧠 MODEL

**GGML joins Hugging Face.** The creator of llama.cpp — the backbone of nearly every local LLM deployment (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) — is joining HF. This means better resources, faster development, and a stronger future for running AI on your own hardware. Easily the most consequential open-source AI move this week.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY: Git Worktrees for AI Agents

When Claude Code gets "git worktree support," it means multiple AI agents can each check out a separate working copy of the same repo simultaneously. Think of it like giving each agent their own desk with their own copy of the codebase — they can all work in parallel without stepping on each other's changes. When done, their work merges back together. This is how teams of AI agents will work on large codebases.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY: GGML Joins Hugging Face

Why this matters more than any model release this week: llama.cpp processes billions of local AI queries daily. It's the invisible infrastructure behind Ollama, LM Studio, Jan, and dozens of other tools. Georgi Gerganov (GGML creator) joining HF means the most important local AI engine now has institutional backing, dedicated resources, and deeper integration with the largest model hub. The local AI ecosystem just got its strongest foundation yet. [Read more →](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759)
