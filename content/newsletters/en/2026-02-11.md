## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "server-side compaction"?**  
When AI agents run for extended periods, their conversation history grows until it exceeds the model's context window—the maximum amount of text it can process at once. Server-side compaction automatically summarizes older parts of the conversation, preserving essential information while freeing up space for new context. This lets agents maintain coherent multi-hour sessions without losing track of what they're doing, a critical capability for autonomous coding and research tasks.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**OpenAI's Responses API primitives for long-running agents**

This is infrastructure, not a flashy demo—and that's why it matters. Server-side compaction and networked containers solve two of the hardest problems in deploying real autonomous agents: context limits and internet access. Combined with GPT-5.2 in deep research, OpenAI is clearly building toward agents that can work independently for hours. The agentic future just got more concrete.
