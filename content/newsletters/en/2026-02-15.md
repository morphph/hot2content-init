# Anthropic's $380B Valuation Tops the Charts as GPT-5.2 Does Actual Physics

The AI funding wars have a new winner: Anthropic just raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation, making it one of the most valuable private companies on Earth. Meanwhile, OpenAI's GPT-5.2 quietly derived a genuinely new result in theoretical physics — not summarized, not retrieved, *derived*. The machines are now doing science.

**Today:** Anthropic's monster raise, AI doing real physics research, and Apple goes all-in on Claude agents in Xcode.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "full-duplex" in AI models?** Traditional voice AI works like a walkie-talkie: one party talks, then the other responds. Full-duplex models (like MiniCPM-o 4.5 and NVIDIA's PersonaPlex) can listen, think, and speak simultaneously — more like a real human conversation where you can interrupt, overlap, and respond in real-time without waiting for rigid turn boundaries.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**GPT-5.2 derives new physics** — This isn't retrieval or summarization. OpenAI's model produced a genuinely novel result about gluon interactions in theoretical physics. We've crossed a threshold: AI systems are now capable of original scientific contribution, not just accelerating human researchers. The implications for drug discovery, materials science, and mathematics are staggering.
