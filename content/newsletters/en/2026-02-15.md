# Anthropic's $30B Round and OpenAI's Ad Experiment Mark a Pivotal Week in AI

The AI industry just witnessed its largest funding round ever: Anthropic closed $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation. Meanwhile, OpenAI quietly began testing ads in ChatGPT, signaling very different paths forward for the two frontier labs. **Today:** massive enterprise deployments, GPT-5.2's physics breakthrough, and China's GLM-5 enters the agentic race.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is server-side compaction?** When AI agents work on long tasks, they accumulate context — every file read, every tool call, every response. Eventually they hit the model's context limit and forget earlier work. Server-side compaction is OpenAI's solution: the server automatically summarizes and compresses older context, letting agents run for hours instead of minutes without losing critical information. Think of it as giving the agent a notebook it can review instead of relying purely on short-term memory.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic's $30B funding round** — This isn't just about the money. At $380B valuation, Anthropic is now worth more than most tech companies that took decades to build. It validates that frontier AI labs are strategic assets worth betting national-scale capital on, and reshapes the competitive dynamics between Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. The question now: what does Anthropic build with essentially unlimited resources? [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2022023155423002867)
