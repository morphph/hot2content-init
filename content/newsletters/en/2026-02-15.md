# Anthropic Raises $30B as AI Labs Race for Infrastructure Dominance

The AI funding wars just hit a new ceiling. Anthropic closed a $30 billion round at a $380 billion valuation—the largest AI funding round in history—while simultaneously publishing Claude's actual training constitution and dropping $20M into a bipartisan AI policy organization. Meanwhile, OpenAI quietly removed "safely" from its mission statement, and Coursera got caught hiding prompt injections in copy-paste to trap AI agents.

**Today:** Anthropic's massive funding and transparency moves, Claude Code's rapid feature expansion, and why IBM is tripling entry-level hiring after discovering AI's limits.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is an "elicitation attack"?** Anthropic's new research reveals a subtle danger: you can take an open-source model, fine-tune it on seemingly innocent chemistry data generated by frontier models, and end up with a model much better at dangerous tasks. The benign-looking training data acts as a key that "unlocks" capabilities the base model wouldn't express. This matters because it shows safety isn't just about what a model knows—it's about what combinations of fine-tuning can draw out. [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2015870963792142563)

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic's $30B raise at $380B valuation** — The largest AI funding round ever signals where capital thinks the future lies: infrastructure-heavy frontier labs. Combined with publishing Claude's constitution and the $20M policy spend, Anthropic is making a play to be both the most capable and most transparent major AI lab. Whether those goals remain compatible at this scale is the question that matters. [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2022023155423002867)
