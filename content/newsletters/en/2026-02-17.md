# OpenAI Launches Enterprise Agent Platform as Anthropic's Opus 4.6 Builds a Working C Compiler

The battle for enterprise AI agents just escalated. OpenAI unveiled Frontier, a full platform for deploying "AI coworkers that can do real work," while Anthropic casually mentioned their Opus 4.6 agent teams spent two weeks autonomously building a C compiler that now runs on Linux. Meanwhile, Qwen dropped a 397B-parameter multimodal agent model, and ChatGPT crossed 4 billion messages in a single day.

**Today:** Enterprise agent platforms go head-to-head, open-source multimodal models catch up, and new research questions whether AI-assisted coding actually helps developers learn.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is a sabotage risk report?** Anthropic published its first "sabotage risk report" for Opus 4.6, fulfilling a commitment they made when releasing Opus 4.5. As models approach AI Safety Level 4 (ASL-4) — the threshold for autonomous AI R&D capabilities — Anthropic evaluates whether the model could sabotage safety measures, deceive operators, or undermine oversight mechanisms. The report documents specific tests and findings, establishing transparency standards for frontier model deployment. [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2021397952791707696)

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**AI coding may hurt skill development** — Anthropic ran an experiment with software engineers and found that coding with AI led to decreased skill mastery, though outcomes depended heavily on usage patterns. This is the first rigorous evidence on how AI assistance affects developer learning, not just productivity. Worth reading if you're a junior dev or manage one.
