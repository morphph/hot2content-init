Warns 2026 could be the "slopocalypse" if quality control doesn't keep pace. The shift is happening faster than most realize. [Read more →](https://x.com/AISafetyMemes/status/2016160041108177266)

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "full-duplex" voice AI?** Traditional voice assistants use a turn-based system: you speak, it listens, it processes, then it responds. Full-duplex models like NVIDIA's PersonaPlex can listen and speak simultaneously, similar to natural human conversation where people interrupt, overlap, and respond in real-time. This eliminates the awkward pauses and "your turn" feel of current voice AI.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Microsoft's BitNet.cpp open-source release** — Running 100B parameter models on CPUs without GPUs fundamentally changes who can deploy large language models. While 1-bit quantization involves trade-offs, this is a meaningful step toward making frontier-scale inference accessible to developers and organizations without expensive GPU infrastructure. The 82% energy reduction also matters for sustainability. [Read more →](https://x.com/oliviscusAI/status/2016841355964641347)
