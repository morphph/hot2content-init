# Anthropic Measures Agent Autonomy While OpenAI Drops a $1.78M Lesson in Vibe-Coded Solidity

The lab wars are getting methodical. Anthropic dropped the first large-scale empirical study on how much autonomy people actually grant AI agents, analyzing millions of Claude Code and API interactions. Meanwhile, OpenAI's Codex gets its own skills system, Google's Lyria 3 generates full tracks with vocals, and the open-source world is drowning in AI slop. Today: agent autonomy research, the real cost of AI-written smart contracts, and skills becoming an industry standard.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is an "agent skill"?**  
A skill is a reusable bundle of instructions, scripts, and resources that tells an AI coding agent how to complete a specific task — like running tests, deploying code, or analyzing security vulnerabilities. Instead of explaining the same workflow every time, you package it once as a skill. Now that skills are an open standard, the same skill file works across Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and other agent platforms.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic's AI Agent Autonomy Research**  
Anthropic analyzed millions of real interactions to answer the question everyone building agents should be asking: how much autonomy do people actually grant? The findings reveal deployment patterns and risk profiles that matter for anyone shipping agents to production. This is the first large-scale empirical data on agent autonomy in the wild.
