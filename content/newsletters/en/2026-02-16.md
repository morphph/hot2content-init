# GPT-5.2 Breaks New Ground in Physics While Anthropic Lands $30B Mega-Round

OpenAI's GPT-5.2 just co-authored a legitimate physics paper with researchers from Harvard, Cambridge, and the Institute for Advanced Study — not summarizing existing work, but deriving a genuinely new result about gluon interactions. Meanwhile, Anthropic closed the largest AI funding round in history at a $380B valuation, and Zhipu AI dropped GLM-5, a 744B-parameter model built for agentic engineering.

**Today:** AI models doing real science, massive capital flows reshaping the industry, and a wave of infrastructure upgrades for long-running agents.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What does "high cybersecurity capability" mean?**

OpenAI flagged GPT-5.3-Codex as "high cybersecurity capability" under its Preparedness Framework. This means the model can assist with sophisticated security tasks — finding vulnerabilities, analyzing code for exploits, understanding complex attack patterns. It's powerful enough to be genuinely useful for security professionals, which also means it requires careful access controls. OpenAI is doing a phased rollout rather than broad release precisely because capability cuts both ways.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**GPT-5.2's physics discovery** — This isn't AI summarizing papers or finding patterns in existing data. GPT-5.2 contributed to deriving a genuinely new result about gluon interactions, co-authored with researchers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard, Cambridge, and Vanderbilt. We've crossed from AI-as-tool to AI-as-collaborator in scientific discovery. The implications for research velocity across every field are significant.
