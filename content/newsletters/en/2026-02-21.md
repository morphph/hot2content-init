# Claude Code Desktop Ships Preview Mode While Opus 4.6 Hunts Vulnerabilities

Anthropic dominated the week with a triple release: Claude Sonnet 4.6 dropped Monday, Claude Code Desktop gained the ability to see what it builds, and Opus 4.6 quietly found 500+ security holes in open-source projects. Meanwhile, OpenAI pushed new image generation models and Google's Sundar Pichai gave his "AI is my biggest dream" speech at the AI Impact Summit.

**Today:** Claude Code's new preview features, Anthropic's security research push, and practical tips for prompt caching in agentic systems.

## 📱 APP

• **Claude Code Desktop gets Preview mode** — Claude can now spin up dev servers, take screenshots of running apps, and iterate visually without you being the manual tester. Also adds auto-review for code and background handling of CI failures and PRs. This closes a major loop in the AI-assisted dev workflow. — @claudeai [Read more →](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2024937960572104707)

• **ChatGPT Code Blocks support interactive visualizations** — OpenAI's code execution environment now renders interactive charts and visualizations inline. — @ChatGPTapp [Read more →](https://x.com/ChatGPTapp/status/2024641787709772226)

## 🔧 DEV

• **Advanced tool use hits Claude API** — Three new beta features let Claude discover, learn, and execute tools dynamically. Moves beyond static tool definitions toward agents that can adapt their capabilities at runtime. — Anthropic Engineering [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use)

• **Claude API now supports 1M token context** — Pass the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header and send ~750,000 words in a single call. Entire codebases, full contracts, hours of transcripts—no chunking required. — @adocomplete [Read more →](https://x.com/adocomplete/status/2024923245611536693)

• **The Bash Tool deep-dive** — Day 19 of the Claude API series covers persistent shell sessions. Install, write, run, debug—all in one flow where every command builds on the last. — @adocomplete [Read more →](https://x.com/adocomplete/status/2024738824564392333)

## 📝 TECHNIQUE

• **Design agents for prompt caching first** — Key insight from the Claude Code team: prompt caching touches almost every feature in agentic systems. If you're building agents and not thinking about cache hits, you're leaving performance (and money) on the table. — @trq212 [Read more →](https://x.com/trq212/status/2024638793719177291)

• **Effective harnesses for long-running agents** — Agents struggle across multiple context windows. Anthropic's engineering team looked to human engineers for inspiration on building better agent harnesses. Worth reading if you're running agents beyond single-shot tasks. — Anthropic Engineering [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)

• **Infrastructure noise swings coding benchmarks by percentage points** — Sometimes more than the gap between top models on leaderboards. A reminder that benchmark results depend heavily on how you run them. — Anthropic Engineering [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/infrastructure-noise)

## 🚀 PRODUCT

• **Claude Code Security in research preview** — Scans codebases for vulnerabilities and suggests targeted patches for human review. Catches issues traditional static analysis misses. Rolling out slowly to Team and Enterprise customers first. — Anthropic Blog (Feb 20) [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-security)

• **Anthropic partners with Infosys for telecom AI agents** — Building AI agents for telecommunications and other regulated industries. Enterprise deployment continues. — Anthropic Blog (Feb 17) [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-infosys)

• **Anthropic signs MOU with Rwanda** — Focus on AI in health and education. Interesting to see frontier labs building government partnerships outside the usual US/EU corridors. — Anthropic Blog (Feb 17) [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-rwanda-mou)

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is prompt caching and why does it matter for agents?**

When you send a prompt to an LLM, the model processes every token from scratch. Prompt caching lets the API remember the processed state of repeated prompt prefixes—so if your system prompt stays the same across calls, you don't pay to process it again. For agents that make dozens or hundreds of API calls with similar context, this cuts latency and cost dramatically. The catch: you have to architect your prompts so the cacheable parts come first and stay stable.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Claude Code Desktop Preview Mode** — This is the feature that makes AI coding assistants feel less like autocomplete and more like a junior dev who can actually check their own work. Claude spins up your app, takes screenshots, and iterates until the UI matches intent. No more copy-pasting error messages or describing what you see. The feedback loop just got a lot tighter.
