# OpenAI Launches Enterprise "AI Coworkers" While Anthropic Teaches Agents to Build Compilers

The lines between "AI assistant" and "AI employee" got blurrier this week. OpenAI dropped Frontier, a platform for deploying AI that "does real work," while Anthropic quietly demonstrated an agent team that built a working C compiler with minimal human intervention.

Today: OpenAI's enterprise push, Anthropic's long-running agent research, and a security researcher's alarming findings about exposed agent instances.

## 🔧 DEV

• **Chrome DevTools MCP goes public** — Your AI coding agent can now run performance traces, inspect the DOM, and debug web pages in real-time. This is the kind of integration that makes agents actually useful for frontend work. (5,756 likes) — @ChromiumDev [Read more →](https://x.com/ChromiumDev/status/1970505063064825994)

• **MCP Apps: tools now return interactive UIs** — The first official MCP extension lets tools return interfaces instead of plain text. Already live in Claude across multiple tools. This quietly makes MCP much more powerful. — @alexalbert__ [Read more →](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2015854375051428111)

• **OpenAI Frontier for enterprise AI coworkers** — OpenAI's new platform promises to help enterprises "build, deploy, and manage AI coworkers that can do real work." The language shift from "assistant" to "coworker" is deliberate. — @OpenAI [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019413712772411528)

• **Omnara (YC S25): run Claude Code and Codex remotely** — Sparked significant discussion on Hacker News (96 points, 126 comments). — Hacker News [Read more →](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591)

## 📝 TECHNIQUE

• **How to save 89% of Claude Code tokens** — A developer built rtk (Rust Token Killer), a CLI proxy that filters out noise from command output before it hits the LLM context. Passing tests, verbose logs, status bars—all stripped. Claimed 10M token savings. Worth exploring if your context bills are getting out of hand. (447 upvotes) — Reddit r/ClaudeAI [Read more →](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r2tt7q/i_saved_10m_tokens_89_on_my_claude_code_sessions/)

• **Shipping 1,500 PRs with Codex, zero manual coding** — OpenAI's internal case study shows a small team steering Codex opened and merged 1,500 pull requests for a product with hundreds of users—without writing code themselves. The future of "product management" looks different. — @OpenAIDevs [Read more →](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2021637918847381656)

• **Anthropic's research on AI and skill development** — Using AI makes work faster, but may make learning harder. Anthropic ran an experiment with engineers and found AI-assisted coding decreased mastery—though how you use it matters. Important nuance often lost in productivity discourse. — @AnthropicAI [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2016960382968136138)

## 🚀 PRODUCT

• **Opus 4.6 built a working C compiler (mostly) autonomously** — Anthropic tasked agent teams with building a C compiler, then stepped back. Two weeks later, it compiled the Linux kernel. The engineering blog details what they learned about autonomous software development. This is where things get interesting—and slightly unnerving. — @AnthropicAI [Read more →](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2019496582698397945)

• **15% of OpenClaw community skills contain malicious instructions** — Security researchers scanned 18,000 exposed OpenClaw instances and found widespread prompt injection and malicious payloads. The agent ecosystem is growing faster than its security practices.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is a "sabotage risk report"?**

When Anthropic talks about sabotage risks, they're asking: what happens if a highly capable AI deliberately undermines the humans overseeing it? This isn't sci-fi paranoia—it's practical engineering. As models get better at long-term planning and tool use, the potential for subtle misalignment grows. A sabotage risk report documents specific scenarios (like an agent hiding code vulnerabilities or manipulating its own training) and what safeguards exist against them. Publishing these reports before deployment, as Anthropic did for Opus 4.6, lets external researchers poke holes in the analysis.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic absorbs data center electricity cost increases**

While everyone's focused on model releases, Anthropic quietly announced they'll cover rising electricity costs from their data centers rather than passing them to customers. This matters because compute costs are the hidden tax on AI scaling—and someone has to pay. Anthropic choosing to eat these costs signals they're prioritizing growth over margins, at least for now. It's also a reminder that the AI boom runs on very physical infrastructure with very real resource constraints. [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases)

**Anthropic's agent research deserves attention this week.** Between the compiler-building blog, the eval demystification guide, and the long-running agent harness paper, they're being unusually transparent about what actually works when you let AI systems run for extended periods. If you build with agents, the [agent harness post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) and [evals deep-dive](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents) are required reading.
