# Anthropic Hits $380B Valuation as Claude Opus 4.6 Drops

The AI arms race just got a new price tag. Anthropic closed a $30 billion Series G at a staggering $380 billion valuation—the largest private funding round in tech history—while simultaneously shipping Claude Opus 4.6.

Today: Anthropic's mega-round and new model, Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think upgrade, and HuggingFace brings Transformers.js to v4.

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "infrastructure noise" in benchmarks?**  
When researchers test AI models, the results depend not just on the model but on how the test environment is configured—things like timeout settings, retry logic, and hardware specs. Anthropic's new research shows these factors can swing scores by several percentage points. This matters because leaderboard rankings often separate models by just 1-2 points. A model that "wins" might simply have been tested under more favorable conditions.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic's $30B raise at $380B valuation**  
This isn't just another funding round—it's a signal that the AI infrastructure buildout is entering a new phase. At $380B, Anthropic is now valued higher than most public tech companies. The capital will likely fund compute, talent, and the safety research that differentiates Anthropic's pitch. Whether the valuation holds depends on whether enterprise revenue catches up to the hype.
