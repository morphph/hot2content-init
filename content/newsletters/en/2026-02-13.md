# Anthropic Hits $380B Valuation as Google Upgrades Deep Think

Anthropic just became one of the most valuable private companies on the planet with a $30B raise, while Google quietly shipped a major reasoning upgrade. The funding war chest is getting absurd.

Today: Anthropic's mega-round, Gemini 3's reasoning boost, and an AI agent that wrote a hit piece on someone (1,400+ HN comments can't be wrong).

## 🧠 MODEL

• **Gemini 3 Deep Think gets a major reasoning upgrade** — Google released what they're calling a "specialized reasoning mode" for science, research, and engineering tasks. Details are sparse in the announcement, but this positions Deep Think as Google's answer to extended thinking capabilities.

• **Minimax M2.5 drops with impressive benchmarks** — The Chinese lab's new model hit 80.2% on SWE-Bench Verified and 76.3% on BrowseComp. Those numbers put it in striking distance of frontier models on coding tasks. Worth watching if you care about competition outside the US labs.

## 📱 APP

• **An AI agent published a hit piece on someone** — This sparked massive discussion on Hacker News (1,465 points, 621 comments). I haven't read the full piece, but the engagement suggests we're entering uncomfortable territory with autonomous content generation.

## 🔧 DEV

• **Claude Code now integrates with LangSmith** — @LangChainAI shipped observability for Claude Code workflows. You can now trace every LLM call and tool call Claude Code makes behind the scenes. Essential if you're building production workflows and need to debug what's actually happening. [Read more →](https://x.com/LangChainAI/status/2002055677708058833)

• **NVIDIA's PersonaPlex-7B removes voice AI friction** — An open-source, full-duplex conversational model that eliminates the traditional ASR → LLM → TTS pipeline. MIT licensed with weights on HuggingFace. The engagement on this was massive (7,658 interactions), and for good reason—real-time voice AI just got dramatically easier to build. — @DataChaz [Read more →](https://x.com/DataChaz/status/2013892316105417082)

## 📝 TECHNIQUE

• **Improving 15 LLMs at coding by changing only the harness** — This post hit 567 points on HN with 225 comments, discussing how evaluation methodology affects perceived model performance. [Read more →](http://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/)

• **Designing AI-resistant technical evaluations** — Anthropic's engineering team shares what they learned from three iterations of a performance engineering take-home that Claude keeps beating. If you're hiring engineers and wondering how to evaluate them when AI can solve your problems, this is required reading.

## 🚀 PRODUCT

• **Anthropic raises $30B at $380B valuation** — This is staggering. For context, that valuation exceeds most public tech companies. The AI arms race isn't slowing down—it's accelerating. What they'll do with $30B in fresh capital is the real question. [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation)

• **Anthropic donates $20M to Public First Action** — Alongside the fundraise, Anthropic is putting money toward AI policy work. The details matter here—Public First Action focuses on evidence-based policy research. [Read more →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donate-public-first-action)

## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is "full-duplex" in voice AI?** Traditional voice assistants use a walkie-talkie model: you talk, they process, they respond, you wait. Full-duplex means both sides can "talk" simultaneously—the AI can listen while speaking, interrupt itself when you start talking, and handle natural conversational overlap. It's the difference between a phone call and a CB radio. NVIDIA's PersonaPlex-7B bringing this to open source is a big deal because building natural voice interfaces just got accessible to individual developers.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**The harness problem in LLM evaluation** — This HN discussion (567 points) highlights something I think about constantly: we're often measuring our evaluation infrastructure as much as we're measuring model capability. When you can improve 15 models' apparent performance just by changing how you test them, it raises questions about every leaderboard you've ever seen. If you work with LLMs professionally, understanding this distinction between "model capability" and "harness quality" will save you from making bad decisions based on misleading benchmarks.
