## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**Tree-sitter Parsing for Code AI** — Tree-sitter is a parser generator that creates concrete syntax trees respecting language grammar, unlike simple tokenization. For LLM-based code tools, this means understanding functions, classes, and scopes structurally rather than as text sequences. CodeRLM demonstrates how this enables more reliable code indexing—agents navigate by semantic boundaries (e.g., "find all method definitions") instead of regex patterns prone to false matches.
