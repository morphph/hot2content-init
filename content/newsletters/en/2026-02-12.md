## 🎓 MODEL LITERACY

**What is a sabotage risk report?** As AI models approach capabilities that could enable autonomous research and development, safety teams assess whether models might deliberately undermine safety mechanisms, oversight processes, or alignment procedures. A sabotage risk report evaluates scenarios where a model could exploit vulnerabilities in its training, deployment, or monitoring infrastructure—essentially testing whether the AI could "work against" human control systems if it developed misaligned goals. Anthropic's report for Claude Opus 4.6 represents the first public documentation of this emerging safety practice.

## 🎯 PICK OF THE DAY

**Anthropic commits to electricity price coverage for data centers** — Anthropic announced it will cover electricity price increases for its data center operations, a rare public commitment that signals confidence in long-term economics despite AI training costs. The move matters because energy costs represent the largest variable expense in frontier model development, and willingness to absorb volatility suggests Anthropic believes model capabilities will justify sustained infrastructure investment regardless of utility pricing.
