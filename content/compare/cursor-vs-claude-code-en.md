## Quick Verdict
Cursor is ideal for developers who want AI-powered coding within a full-featured IDE with visual diff previews and multi-model flexibility. Claude Code is the choice for developers who prefer terminal-first workflows and need maximum autonomy for complex, multi-step coding tasks. Cursor offers polish and accessibility; Claude Code offers depth and control.

## Feature Comparison

| Context Window | Varies by model | Up to 1M tokens |
| Multi-file Editing | ✅ Visual diffs, Composer | ✅ Direct file edits |
| Code Execution | ✅ Terminal integration | ✅ Native command execution |
| MCP Support | ✅ Recently added | ✅ Full ecosystem |
| Codebase Indexing | ✅ Built-in semantic search | ✅ Via codebase context |
| Visual Diff Preview | ✅ Inline accept/reject | ❌ Terminal-based |
| Agent Teams | ❌ Not available | ✅ Parallel sub-agents |

## Pricing
| Plan | Cursor | Claude Code |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Free | 2 weeks Pro trial | API credits only |
| Pro | $20/month (500 fast requests) | Usage-based (~$5-25/M tokens) |
| Business | $40/user/month | Claude Max ($100-200/month) |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

## Developer Experience
| Aspect | Cursor | Claude Code |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Setup Time | Download app, sign in | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Learning Curve | Low (familiar IDE) | Medium (terminal workflow) |
| Workflow | Edit in IDE with AI assist | Describe task, agent executes |
| Review Process | Visual diffs, accept/reject | Review changes in git |
| Customization | Settings UI, rules files | CLAUDE.md, MCP servers |

## Best For
### Choose Cursor when:
- You want a visual IDE with AI built in
- You prefer seeing diffs before accepting changes
- You want to switch between multiple AI models
- You're transitioning from VS Code and want a familiar environment
- You need inline tab completions alongside chat

### Choose Claude Code when:
- You prefer working in the terminal
- You need an agent that can autonomously complete complex multi-step tasks
- You want to leverage the full MCP ecosystem of tools
- You need Agent Teams for parallelized work
- You're working on large codebases that benefit from 1M token context

## Bottom Line
Cursor and Claude Code represent two philosophies of AI-assisted development. Cursor integrates AI into the traditional IDE experience — you stay in control, with AI as a powerful assistant. Claude Code reimagines the developer as a director, describing intent while the agent handles execution. In 2026, many developers use Cursor for everyday coding and Claude Code for complex refactors, migrations, and feature development that benefits from autonomous execution.
