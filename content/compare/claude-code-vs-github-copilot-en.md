## Best For
### Choose Claude Code when:
- You need to build entire features autonomously across multiple files
- Your task requires deep reasoning, debugging, or architectural decisions
- You want to leverage MCP tools (databases, APIs, cloud services)
- You're comfortable with a terminal-based workflow
- You need Agent Teams for parallelized complex tasks

### Choose GitHub Copilot when:
- You want fast inline code completions while typing
- You prefer staying entirely within your IDE
- You need broad language and framework support with minimal setup
- Your team needs a cost-predictable flat-rate plan
- You want code suggestions without giving the tool execution access

## Bottom Line
Claude Code and GitHub Copilot serve fundamentally different workflows. Claude Code is an autonomous coding agent that can plan, execute, test, and iterate on complex tasks. GitHub Copilot is a productivity booster that speeds up the code you're already writing. Many developers in 2026 use both — Copilot for autocomplete while typing, and Claude Code for tackling complex features and refactors.
