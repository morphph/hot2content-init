# AI-Resistant Technical Evaluations

## Definition

AI-resistant technical evaluations are assessment methods designed to accurately measure a candidate's genuine skills and problem-solving abilities in an era where AI coding assistants can complete many standard programming tasks. These evaluations incorporate elements that are difficult for current AI systems to solve autonomously while remaining fair and relevant tests of actual job-related competencies.

## Why It Matters

The rapid advancement of AI coding assistants has fundamentally disrupted traditional technical hiring. Take-home assignments, once considered a reliable way to assess programming skills, can now be completed by tools like Claude, GPT-4, and specialized coding models. This creates a significant challenge: how do you evaluate whether a candidate can actually do the job when AI can do the homework?

Anthropic's engineering team documented this problem directly, noting that Claude kept beating successive iterations of their performance engineering take-home assessment. Each time they redesigned the evaluation to be more challenging, AI capabilities caught up. This arms race illustrates a broader industry challenge—static assessments become obsolete as AI improves.

The stakes extend beyond hiring accuracy. Organizations risk onboarding candidates who cannot perform independently, while genuinely skilled candidates may be disadvantaged if evaluations reward AI-assisted work over demonstrated expertise. Finding the right balance between leveraging AI tools (a legitimate modern skill) and verifying core competencies has become essential.

## How It Works

AI-resistant evaluations typically employ several strategies:

**System-level reasoning**: Problems requiring understanding of complex, interconnected systems rather than isolated functions. AI excels at generating code snippets but struggles with holistic architectural decisions.

**Ambiguous requirements**: Real-world scenarios where the "right" answer depends on tradeoffs and judgment calls that require clarifying questions and stakeholder communication.

**Live collaboration**: Pair programming or live coding sessions where evaluators observe the candidate's thought process, debugging approach, and ability to respond to changing requirements in real-time.

**Novel problem domains**: Custom scenarios using proprietary systems or unusual constraints that don't appear in AI training data.

**Explanation and defense**: Requiring candidates to explain their reasoning, critique alternatives, and defend decisions verbally—testing understanding rather than output.
