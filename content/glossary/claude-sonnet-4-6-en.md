# Claude Sonnet 4.6

## Definition

Claude Sonnet 4.6 is Anthropic's latest mid-tier large language model, released on February 17, 2026. It represents a significant upgrade over Sonnet 4.5, delivering near-Opus-level intelligence while maintaining the same pricing structure as its predecessor. The model features a 1 million token context window in beta, making it one of the most capable models in its price category.

## Why It Matters

Sonnet 4.6 closes the gap between Anthropic's flagship Opus models and the more cost-effective Sonnet tier. According to early adopters, it "gives even Opus 4.6 a run for its money," suggesting that developers can now access near-top-tier reasoning capabilities without paying premium prices. This price-performance shift has significant implications for production AI deployments where cost efficiency matters.

The model arrives with improvements across multiple domains: coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. For development teams building AI agents or integrating LLMs into workflows, these upgrades translate directly to more capable autonomous systems and more reliable code generation.

The 1 million token context window—currently in beta—addresses a persistent limitation in AI applications. Developers working with large codebases, lengthy documents, or complex multi-turn conversations can now process substantially more information in a single request, reducing the need for chunking strategies and retrieval augmentation in many use cases.

## How It Works

Like other Claude models, Sonnet 4.6 is a transformer-based large language model trained using Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach. The model processes input text (prompts) and generates contextually relevant responses through attention mechanisms that weigh relationships between tokens across the entire context window.

The 1M token context window means the model can attend to approximately 750,000 words of input text simultaneously. This extended context is managed through optimized attention patterns that maintain coherence across long sequences while keeping inference costs manageable.

For agent workflows, Sonnet 4.6's improved planning capabilities allow it to break down complex tasks, maintain state across multiple tool calls, and recover from errors more effectively than previous versions.
