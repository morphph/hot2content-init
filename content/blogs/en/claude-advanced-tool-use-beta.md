I need web access to fetch the actual technical details from Anthropic's announcement about the Claude advanced tool use beta. Without being able to fetch the source material, I cannot write an accurate, factual article about this feature.

Could you either:
1. Grant permission for WebFetch/WebSearch tools, or
2. Provide the key details from the Anthropic Engineering announcement (the three new beta features, how they work, API parameters, etc.)

This will ensure the article contains accurate technical information rather than speculation.
