# Unsloth Fine-Tuning Optimization

**TL;DR:** Unsloth delivers 2x faster fine-tuning with 70% less VRAM through custom CUDA kernels and memory optimization — enabling you to train Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, and other models on consumer GPUs.

## What is Unsloth?

Unsloth is an open-source library that optimizes LLM fine-tuning by rewriting core training operations in custom Triton kernels. It integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face Transformers and supports popular models including Llama 3, Qwen 2.5, DeepSeek, Gemma 2, Mistral, and Phi-4.

The key value proposition: train the same models on cheaper hardware, or train larger models on your existing setup.
