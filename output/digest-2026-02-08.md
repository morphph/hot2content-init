New on the Engineering Blog: Quantifying infrastructure noise in agentic coding evals.

Infrastructure configuration can swing agentic coding benchmarks by several percentage points—sometimes more than the leaderboard gap between top models.

New Engineering blog: We tasked Opus 4.6 using agent teams to build a C compiler. Then we (mostly) walked away. Two weeks later, it worked on the Linux kernel. 

Here's what it taught us about the future of autonomous software development.
