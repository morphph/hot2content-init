  "one_liner": "Anthropic releases Claude Opus 4.6 with Agent Teams, enabling 16 parallel AI agents to autonomously build a 100,000-line C compiler for $20,000.",

  "key_points": [
    "Agent Teams enables multiple Claude Code instances to work in parallel with independent context windows and peer-to-peer communication, fundamentally different from sequential subagents.",
    "The Carlini Experiment demonstrated 16 agents building a full C compiler in Rust that compiles Linux 6.9 kernel, passes 99% of GCC torture tests, and runs Doom—all for $20,000 in API costs.",
    "Opus 4.6 introduces a 1 million token context window (beta) and 128K max output tokens, specifically engineered for long-running agentic workflows.",
    "The release coincided within 27 minutes of OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex launch, marking an intensification of the multi-agent AI coding race.",
    "Agent Teams is currently a research preview requiring manual enablement via CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 environment variable."
  ],

  "story_spine": {
    "background": "As AI coding assistants evolved from autocomplete to autonomous agents, a fundamental limitation emerged: single-session context degradation. Long conversations caused 'context rot' where models lost track of earlier decisions. Meanwhile, complex engineering tasks require parallel exploration—something a linear assistant couldn't provide. The industry needed a paradigm shift from AI as copilot to AI as coordinated team.",
    "breakthrough": "On February 5, 2026, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 with Agent Teams—a swarm-based architecture where multiple Claude instances operate as independent teammates. Unlike subagents that report linearly to a parent, Agent Teams features peer-to-peer communication, shared task lists with file locking, and a mailbox system for async messaging. Each teammate maintains its own context window, eliminating context rot. The lead agent orchestrates but doesn't bottleneck.",
    "mechanism": "Agent Teams operates through four core components: (1) The Team Lead—primary session handling planning, decomposition, and synthesis; (2) Teammates—independent Claude Code instances with isolated contexts loading project files like CLAUDE.md; (3) Shared Task List—file-based synchronization at ~/.claude/tasks/ with state tracking and dependency management; (4) The Mailbox—inter-agent messaging via 'message' and 'broadcast' commands. Users control display via --teammate-mode flag (in-process or split-pane with tmux/iTerm2). Delegation mode (Shift+Tab) lets the lead focus purely on orchestration.",
    "significance": "The Carlini Experiment proved the concept at scale: 16 agents autonomously produced 100,000 lines of Rust code over two weeks, creating a C compiler that successfully builds Linux 6.9 for x86, ARM, and RISC-V. At $20,000, this represents a fraction of what a human team would cost for equivalent work. The implications extend beyond compilers—parallel code review with specialized 'lenses' (security, performance, architecture), competing hypothesis debugging, and cross-layer refactoring become practical. This marks the transition from 'AI assistant' to 'AI engineering team.'",
    "risks": "The $20,000 price tag makes Agent Teams prohibitive for routine development—it's currently suited for high-value, complex projects only. File conflicts remain problematic when multiple agents edit the same files; task decomposition quality directly impacts success. The 'research preview' designation signals instability. Community concerns around 'Vibe Coding' suggest over-reliance on AI orchestration without human oversight. Cost optimization and conflict resolution tooling are needed before mainstream adoption."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How is Agent Teams different from Claude Code subagents?",
      "answer": "Subagents run within the main session's lifecycle and report only to the caller—they're sequential. Agent Teams creates independent processes with their own context windows that communicate peer-to-peer. Subagents suit quick tool usage; Agent Teams suits parallel exploration of massive codebases."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to run Agent Teams?",
      "answer": "Opus 4.6 pricing is $5/M input tokens and $25/M output tokens (same as Opus 4.5). The C compiler experiment cost ~$20,000 over two weeks with 16 agents. For typical use cases with 2-4 agents on smaller tasks, expect costs in the $50-500 range depending on complexity and duration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Agent Teams today?",
      "answer": "Yes, but it's a research preview. Enable it by setting CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 in your environment or ~/.claude/settings.json. Expect rough edges—the feature is explicitly experimental."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Agent Teams compare to OpenAI Codex?",
      "answer": "Claude Agent Teams focuses on deep reasoning and multi-day complex tasks with swarm-based architecture. OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex emphasizes execution speed and OS integration as a 'workhorse.' Benchmarks show Claude leads in reasoning and verified code-fix tasks; Codex leads in execution speed and environment interaction."
